# Augmented Reality Pong
<p>AR version of the classic game pong</p>

<body> Starting with this year's HackHarvard 2016 theme of "reinventing the past", we were inspired to recreate a classic game that had us mesmerized in the past to mesmerize people in the present. In the spirit of today's interest in virtual reality and augmented reality, we decided to add an augmented reality twist to the old game of Pong. Moreover, as Canadians in America, we wanted to show our investment in America's political scene by adding a "presidential" twist to our game of Pong.

PongHub.org is a web application developed for optimized usage with the Orion Leap Motion augmented reality interface. Come discover our AR twist on a historical classic, cherished by many a knowledgeable gaming enthusiast. Either use the Orion LeapMotion hardware to control the paddles with your hands in thin air, or use the alternate keyboard controls for those without the Leapmotion.
